Make Sure to add these besides eslint to your project:

> npm i eslint-plugin-react-hooks
> npm i eslint-config-react-app

Turns off all rules that are unnecessary or might conflict with Prettier:

> npm install --save-dev eslint-config-prettier

If you want to enforce that files are formatted before a pull request is merged, use:
> prettier --check
for your continuous integration.

Typescript:
> npm i @types/react @types/react-dom
